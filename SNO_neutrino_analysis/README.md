SNO Solar Neutrino Analysis
Ashok Kumar Ramu — University of Waterloo
Reproduction of the SNO Phase I (2002) measurement of the solar neutrino
mixing angle θ₁₂ using the charged-current (CC) and neutral-current (NC)
flux ratio in the adiabatic MSW regime.

Result
θ₁₂ = 36.0° ± 2.3°   (SNO Phase I only, consistent with 2002 publication)
The vacuum-averaged formula predicts P_ee ≈ 0.548 — ruled out by SNO at 5.5σ.
The correct adiabatic MSW formula gives P_ee = sin²(θ₁₂) ≈ 0.303, consistent
with the observed CC/NC ratio of 0.346 ± 0.037.

Physics
High-energy ⁸B solar neutrinos (3–12 MeV) are produced deep in the Sun's core
where electron density is ~10²⁶ cm⁻³. The MSW effect rotates the in-matter
mixing angle to θ_m ≈ 90°, so the neutrino is born as the heavy matter
eigenstate |ν₂ᵐ⟩. Adiabatic propagation through the decreasing solar density
keeps it in that eigenstate all the way to the surface, where it exits as a
pure vacuum mass eigenstate |ν₂⟩. The survival probability is then simply:
P_ee = |⟨νe|ν₂⟩|² = sin²(θ₁₂)
The vacuum-averaged formula P_ee = 1 - ½sin²(2θ) has a hard lower bound of 0.5
and cannot reach the observed ~35% for any physical value of θ₁₂.

The ~2.6° offset from the PDG value arises from two known sources:
the Earth's day-night regeneration effect (slightly inflates the observed P_ee)
and the absence of a KamLAND Δm²₂₁ constraint in the SNO-only fit.

How to Run
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy jupyter
jupyter notebook python_notebook/SNO_neutrino_analysis.ipynb
The script loads data/b8spectrum.csv, performs the chi-squared fit,
and saves all four figure panels.
